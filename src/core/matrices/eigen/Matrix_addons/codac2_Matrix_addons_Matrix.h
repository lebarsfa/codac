/** 
 *  \file codac2_Matrix_addons_Matrix.h
 *  
 *  This class reuses some of the functions developed for ibex::Matrix. 
 *  The original IBEX code is revised in modern C++ and adapted to the template 
 *  structure proposed in Codac, based on the Eigen library.
 *  See ibex::Matrix (IBEX lib, author: Gilles Chabert)
 * 
 *  This file is included in the declaration of Eigen::MatrixBase,
 *  thanks to the preprocessor token EIGEN_MATRIX_PLUGIN.
 *  See: https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/TopicCustomizing_Plugins.html
 *  and the file codac2_matrices.h
